# Design

## Colors

I used [Visme](https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/) to find a suitable color scheme for the website. I went with the first recommendation as I though it would make for a highly attractive combination.

I used [Colormind](http://colormind.io/) to generate a color palette.

* #41B3A3 (green) - This will be used as the background color of the website.
* #E8A87C (light orange) - This will be used as a background color for the buttons.
* #E27D60 (dark orange) - This will be used as a background color for the buttons when hovered over.
* #FFFFFF (white) - This will be used for a background color of the input box.
* #000000 (black) - This will be used for the text on the website.

## Fonts
I have chosen to use the font [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?sort=popularity "Roboto font") which I imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts"). I chose this font because it's a very popular font that is easy to read and also helps to incease the attractiveness of the website.
