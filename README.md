## Colors

I used [Visme](https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/) to find a suitable color scheme for the website. I went with the first recommendation as I though it would make for a highly attractive combination.

I used [Colormind](http://colormind.io/) to generate a color palette.

* #41B3A3 (green) - This will be used as the background color of the website.
* #E8A87C (light orange) - This will be used as a background color for the buttons.
* #E27D60 (dark orange) - This will be used as a background color for the buttons when hovered over.
* #FFFFFF (white) - This will be used for a background color of the input box.
* #000000 (black) - This will be used for the text on the website.
