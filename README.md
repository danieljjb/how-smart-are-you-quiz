# Design

## Colors

I used [Visme](https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/) to find a suitable color scheme for the website. I went with the first recommendation as I though it would make for a highly attractive combination.

I used [Colormind](http://colormind.io/) to generate a color palette.

* #41B3A3 (green) - This will be used as the background color of the website.
* #E8A87C (light orange) - This will be used as a background color for the buttons.
* #E27D60 (dark orange) - This will be used as a background color for the buttons when hovered over.
* #FFFFFF (white) - This will be used for a background color of the input box.
* #000000 (black) - This will be used for the text on the website.

## Fonts
I have chosen to use the font [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?sort=popularity "Roboto font") which I imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts"). I chose this font because it's a very popular font that is easy to read and also helps to incease the attractiveness of the website.

# Testing

# Deployment

## GitHub Pages

I deployed this site on GitHub using the following steps:

1. I opened the repository on GitHub and selected **Settings**.
2. Following this I clicked on **Pages**.
3. Under the heading 'Source', I clicked on 'None' and selected **Main**.
4. I then clicked **Save**.
5. The website then became live here.

## Forking the GitHub Repository

Forks are used to propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. By forking the GitHub Repository you make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository.

To Fork a Github Repository:

1. Log in to GitHub and go to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/danieljjb/how-smart-are-you-quiz)
2. Locate the Fork button in the top-right corner of the page, click **Fork**.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

## Making a Local Clone

You will now have a fork of the repository, but you don't have the files in that repository locally on your computer.

To make a local clone:

1. Log in to GitHub and go to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/danieljjb/how-smart-are-you-quiz)
2. Above the list of files, click  **Code**.
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under **Clone with HTTPS**, click the **Copy** icon. To clone the repository using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click Use SSH, then click the **Copy** icon. To clone a repository using GitHub CLI, click Use GitHub CLI, then click the **Copy** icon.
4. Open Git Bash.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your GitHub AE username instead of YOUR-USERNAME:
7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
