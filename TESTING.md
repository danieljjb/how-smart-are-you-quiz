# Testing
* The website is fully responsive on many different screen sizes and looks good from small devices to larger devices and everything in between. The content is easy to understand and navigate and the color scheme blends everything in well together.
* I tested every button on the website by clicking on them one by one to make sure they did what they were supposed to do. 
* I tested username input at the end of the game by entering a username a clicking save. I then checked the leaderboard to make sure the username had been saved. I also followed these same steps except I did not enter a username and found that default name was used on the leaderboard as planned.
